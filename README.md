# 🚕 Spatio-Temporal Taxi Demand Forecasting using Graph Neural Networks

A production-ready spatio-temporal machine learning system for **zone-level NYC taxi demand prediction**, integrating **graph learning, temporal modeling, and real-time deployment**.

---

## 📌 Project Motivation

Urban mobility systems exhibit strong **spatial and temporal dependencies**.  
Taxi demand in one region is influenced not only by its historical trends but also by **neighboring regions and time-of-day effects**.

Traditional time-series or regression models fail to capture:
- spatial interdependencies between regions  
- non-Euclidean graph structures  
- dynamic temporal evolution  

This project addresses these challenges by modeling **NYC taxi zones as a graph** and applying a **Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ST-GNN)** to forecast hourly demand.

---

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- Graph-based spatial modeling using NYC taxi zone adjacency
- Temporal feature engineering with sliding windows
- Deep learning using **Graph Neural Networks**
- Robust evaluation with regression metrics
- **Real-time inference deployment** using FastAPI
- **Interactive visualization** via Streamlit

## 🗂 Dataset Description

### 1. NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records
- Source: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)
- Format: Parquet
- Time resolution: Hourly aggregation
- Target variable: Number of pickups per zone per hour

### 2. NYC Taxi Zones Shapefile
- Defines **263 official NYC taxi zones**
- Used to derive:
  - spatial adjacency graph
  - zone identifiers and names
  - geographic consistency

After preprocessing and filtering inactive zones, approximately **261 active zones** were retained.

---

## 🗺 Graph Construction (Spatial Modeling)

Each taxi zone is treated as a **node** in a graph.

Edges are created when two zones **share a physical boundary**, computed using geometric adjacency from the official taxi zone shapefile.

This produces:
- an undirected spatial graph  
- non-uniform neighborhood sizes  
- realistic urban connectivity  

The graph is represented using an **edge index** format compatible with PyTorch Geometric.

## ⏱ Temporal Modeling Strategy

### Sliding Window Formulation

A fixed-length look-back window of **T hours** is used to predict the next hour.

Input features include:
- historical demand values  
- normalized hour-of-day  
- normalized day-of-week  

Final input tensor shape:

samples × time_window × number_of_zones × number_of_features

## 🧠 Model Architecture (Technical Core)

### Why Graph Neural Networks?

NYC taxi zones form an **irregular spatial structure**.  
Grid-based models (e.g., CNNs) assume uniform spacing and are unsuitable.

Graph Neural Networks enable:
- message passing between neighboring zones  
- learning spatial spillover effects  
- scalability to non-Euclidean urban layouts  

---

### Architecture Overview

**Spatial Encoder**
- Graph convolution / graph attention layers
- Aggregates neighborhood information
- Captures spatial dependencies

**Temporal Encoder**
- Sliding-window temporal learning
- Models short-term demand dynamics
- Learns periodic patterns

**Prediction Head**
- Fully connected layers
- Outputs next-hour demand per zone

The design balances **expressiveness** and **stability** to avoid overfitting sparse zones.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Methodology

This is a **regression task**.

### Metrics Used

| Metric | Description |
|------|------------|
| RMSE | Penalizes large prediction errors |
| MAE  | Interpretable average absolute error |
| R²   | Proportion of explained variance |

These metrics assess accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

## 📈 Results Summary

- High-demand hubs (airports, downtown areas) are consistently identified
- Low-activity residential zones remain stable
- Spatial modeling improves performance over non-graph baselines

The results demonstrate that **explicit spatial dependency modeling enhances demand forecasting accuracy**.
